# mutation
Small Python program to induce deletion mutation in a protein sequence

For inducing mutations in which the user knows the amino acid to be deleted and its position, the user can enter both pieces of information to delete that amino acid. 

Reads an input file containing the sequence in FASTA format, outputs the same sequence minus the amino acid in FASTA format. Can read in FASTA format, but copies only the protein sequence.
